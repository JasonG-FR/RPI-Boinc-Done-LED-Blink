# RPI-Boinc-Done-LED-Blink
Blink an LED when all Boinc jobs are done using GPIO (Raspberry PI A+, B+, 2 B and 3 B).

The GPIO pin 40 will be used to blink the LED.

This script needs to be launched as root by cron.

You can find the documentation for the numbering of the GPIOs here : https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio-plus-and-raspi2/
